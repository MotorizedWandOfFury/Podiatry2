wait, which folder?
So the form didn't exist and I forgot to do a null check to kill the script if it didn't exist

It good now?

If the form doesn't exist, it'll kill the script. When I added the new extremity field, I defaulted it to 1. Just be aware of that.

ok. I was thinking of just deleting the forms that existed before.

Sure. Then we can work through and each some forms. Do you think we should submit every form?

Actually why not just go into the db and set the eztremity to the first patient. I know it should be a 2.
ew
Sure

Yeah because I was going to test the same patient's other foot. That should be equivalent to resubmitting everything again.
Wait 1 is left?

Yeah

Yeah, don't know how I can create a link for something not there. Wait it's there.

Oh wow, I feel dumb. But it was late at night when I added extremity fields to the stuff. I guess I missed one.

Good?

Can I vardump that?

Wait, which part?

Yeah.

Well that was strange. Hey is that suppose to be labelled that way?

Nope. I dunno how that typo occurred. Good catch.

Now I wonder are there other places that happened.

Doubtful. We'd have seen them. Running through the forms should confirm or deny this. Just keep a lookout, I guess.

what were the git commands you used again?

git add -A to stage the files
git commit -m "commit message blah blah" to commit them

You think I should change that post variable name? Instead of type? I use that for the "switch" statment for the formselection menu.
/formselection.php?patid=' . $userId . '&type=3

You definitely should. Call it "form" maybe?

Ok I think we're stable enough right now. Have any new questions we need to ask?

Not that I can think of. Btw, real quick: let's test the change password for patients. Like, just pick a patient and change the password, log in, change it again, log in again.

Log in as admin or that patient?

Change the password as an admin, then log in as the patient, log out, log in as the admin, change it again, and once more log in as the patient

Well isn't the patient's main page broken right now?

Oh, darn. I'll put fixing it up on my to do. Well, back end stuff wise.

We could try changing it and look in the db and see if the slurry or letters change.

That might be enough. But I'd like to log in as well, just to make sure I guess.

IA'cltluly do it to doctor. I think he said patient is kind of low priority. He wants to submit his forms and tell other doctors to submit their data if they can.

Right. It's the same between them, so either doctor or patient we can test this with. Let's use one a patient or doctor we haven't touched. Maybe Dr. Newton?

Well yeah it changed it. Ooops. uh...

Can't log out.

The session will timeout in 30.

There. So yeah you can sign in with new pass. Ok I think it works what you said to do.

Great. I was worried there was a bug lurking there. Also, we may have to change the password hashing algo to something else. Maybe bcrypt.
I Idon't know encryption so all up to you.

I'll investigate it later.

Though should we have some mechanism for the admin to get back in if the info is lost?
pas
Like password recovery?

Actually we'll think that later. But yeah that is the obvious choice.

I guess so? Let's consider it later.

So what time tomorrow is good with you?

After 4 I guess.

I'll ask what time is good between 4-7 for him. Ddc i think server can't take it anymore.

Okay. That was strange. But we're pretty solid on this right? The functionality he cared more about seems stable, so now he's just gotta check it out.

Yeah. So another Google hangout for conferencing. 

Yep.

I sent the email to him. I'll text you the time when I get it. Going to log for now.

Later. I'm signing out now.
